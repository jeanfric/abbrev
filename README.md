Abbrev is a small library of lossless compression/decompression 
algorithms, written in the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) programming 
language.

Status
------

This library is a hobby project and is neither providing a stable API
nor high-performance implementations of the main lossless algorithms.

Goals
-----

The main goal is to implement most of the published and patent-unencumbered
[lossless compression 
algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lossless_compression_algorithms). 

The library should only depend on the core Clojure library, and should
not 'drop down' to Java implementations.
